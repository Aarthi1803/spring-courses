# 1. spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update --> This property tells Hibernate how to handle database schema changes automatically.  
# update: Modifies existing tables without dropping data.  
# Other options:  
  # none: No automatic schema changes.  
  # create: Drops and recreates tables on every startup.  
  # create-drop: Drops tables when the app stops.  
  # validate : Only checks the schema, doesn’t modify it.
# Real-World Scenario: You’re building an e-commerce application where product details change often. Instead of manually updating the database schema every time you modify an entity, Hibernate updates the schema automatically when the app starts.  
# Use 'update' in development but not in production (use migrations like Flyway or Liquibase). 


# 2️. spring.h2.console.enabled=true --> This enables a web-based console for H2, an in-memory database, so you can query and check the data.  
# Real-World Scenario: Imagine you're a Java developer working on a Spring Boot application with H2 for local testing. Instead of running SQL queries from the code, you can open `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` and run queries directly in a browser.  
# Useful for debugging in local development but should be disabled in production 


# 3️. spring.jpa.show-sql=true --> This logs the actual SQL queries that Hibernate executes in the console.  
# Real-World Scenario :  You are developing a Banking application and want to check if the SQL queries generated by Hibernate are correct before running them in production. Instead of guessing what happens under the hood, you can see the exact SQL Hibernate executes.  
# Great for debugging but should be disabled in production to avoid exposing queries.


# 4. spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect -->  This tells Hibernate to use the correct SQL syntax and functions for MySQL 8.  
# Real-World Scenario : You are working on an application that runs on MySQL 8, but Hibernate by default uses a generic SQL dialect. Setting this property ensures Hibernate generates MySQL-specific queries, optimizing performance and compatibility.  
# Always set the correct dialect to match your database version for better performance.


# 5️. spring.sql.init.mode=always ---> This ensures that SQL scripts (schema.sql, data.sql) run every time the application starts.  
# Options:  
  # always: Run SQL scripts on every startup.  
  # never: Don't run SQL scripts.  
  # embedded: Run SQL scripts only for in-memory databases like H2.  
# Real-World Scenario : You're building a Student Management System and have a data.sql file with initial student records. Every time the app starts, the script populates the database so you don’t have to insert the data manually.  
# Useful for setting up test data in local development.


# 6. spring.sql.init.platform=mysql --> Tells Spring Boot to look for schema-mysql.sql and data-mysql.sql in the resources folder.  
# Real-World Scenario : You're developing an Employee Management System that supports multiple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL). By setting `platform=mysql`, Spring will execute the MySQL-specific SQL scripts.  
# Ensures compatibility with different databases. 


# 7️. spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true  --> This ensures that JPA loads after SQL scripts (schema.sql, data.sql).  
# Real-World Scenario : You're creating a library management system where you need to insert initial data from `data.sql` before Hibernate loads entities. Without this setting, Hibernate might load entities before data.sql runs, causing missing data issues.  
# Use this when both SQL scripts and JPA entity management are used together.



# Summary Table:
# Property 																		Purpose 								 	Real-World Use Case 
# spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update 											Auto-updates database schema  				Avoids manual schema updates in development 
# spring.h2.console.enabled=true 												Enables H2 web console 						Query H2 database via browser for testing
# spring.jpa.show-sql=true 										 				Logs SQL queries							Debug SQL queries generated by Hibernate 
# spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect   Uses MySQL 8 syntax 						Ensures Hibernate runs MySQL-optimized queries 
# spring.sql.init.mode=always 													Runs schema.sql & data.sql at startup 		Inserts initial test data in development 
# spring.sql.init.platform=mysql 												Uses MySQL-specific SQL scripts 			Supports different databases easily 
# spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true  								Ensures SQL scripts run before JPA loads 	Avoids missing data issues when using both SQL scripts & JPA 


# Conclusion
# Use update for development schema updates but Flyway/Liquibase for production.
# Enable show-sql & h2-console only in local development.
# Set platform=mysql to ensure MySQL-specific scripts run.
# Use defer-datasource-initialization=true if you're using both JPA & SQL scripts.
